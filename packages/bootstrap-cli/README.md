# Why this tool?

This tool has been created to address the original problems defined in Symbol's [NIP11](https://github.com/nemtech/NIP/blob/main/NIPs/nip-0011.md).

# Key benefits:

-   It's an installable cli tool. It's not a repo you need to clone and compile.
-   The configuration is parametrized via CLI commands and presets instead of by changing properties files.
-   The tools code is unique for any type of network, new networks or nodes in a network. It doesn't need to be copied and pasted in different projects or assemblies.
-   The config command runs on the host machine, not via docker making it easier to debug or tune
-   It's uses the TS SDK for key generation, vrf transactions, address generation instead of using catapult-tools (nemgen is still used to generate the nemesis block).
-   Easier to maintain, the properties files are reused for all nodes, assemblies and network types.
-   Network setup (how many database, nodes, rest gateways to run) is defined in presets, users can provide their own ones.
-   Docker-compose yaml files are generated based on the network setup/preset instead of being manually created/upgraded.
-   The created network (config, nemesis and docker-compose) can be zipped and distributed for other host machines to run it.
-   The used docker images versions can be changed via configuration/preset
-   It uses the [oclif](https://oclif.io) framework. New commands are easy to add and document.
-   It can be included as a npm dependency for clients' e2e testing.

# Concepts

## Preset:

Yaml files that define the configuration and layout of the network and nodes. It defines how many nodes, database, rest gateways, the modes, keys, etc.

Presets are defined at 4 levels from general to specific:

-   Shared: Default configurations for all the networks.
-   Network: It defines the configuration of a given network.
-   Assembly: It specifies the creates nodes and services for the given network preset.
-   Custom: A user provided yml file (`--customPreset` param) that could override some or all properties in the out-of-the-box presets.

Properties in each file override the previous values (by object deep merge).

### Network Presets:

-   [`mainnet`](presets/mainnet/network.yml): Used to created nodes' connected to Symbol's Mainnet network. The [nemesis block](presets/mainnet/seed/00000) is copied over.
-   [`testnet`](presets/testnet/network.yml): Used to created nodes' connected to Symbol's Testnet network. The [nemesis block](presets/testnet/seed/00000) is copied over.
-   [`dualCurrency`](presets/dualCurrency/network.yml): Used to create new private networks with dual currency configuration, network and harvest currencies. Nemesis block is generated.
-   [`singleCurrency`](presets/singleCurrency/network.yml): Used to create private/user networks with a single network currency configuration, just main network currency. Nemesis block is generated.

### Assemblies:

-   [`dual`](presets/assemblies/assembly-dual.yml): A standard dual node that contains 1 mongo database. 1 api node, 1 rest gateway, and 1 broker.
-   [`peer`](presets/assemblies/assembly-peer.yml): A standard peer only node that contains 1 peer node.
-   [`api`](presets/assemblies/assembly-api.yml): A standard api node that contains 1 mongo database. 1 api node, 1 rest gateway, and 1 broker.
-   [`demo`](presets/assemblies/assembly-demo.yml): A dual node that contains an explorer, web wallet and faucet for test and demonstration purposes.
-   [`multinode`](presets/assemblies/assembly-multinode.yml): An special assembly that contains 1 api node and 2 peer only nodes. This assembly is for testing, it showcases how a private network with 3 nodes runs.

### Custom preset:

It's the way you can tune the network without modifying the code. It's a yml file (`--customPreset` param) that could override some or all properties in the out-of-the-box presets.

Custom presets give Symbol Bootstrap its versatility. Check out the custom preset [guides](docs/presetGuides.md)!

## Target:

The folder where the generated config, docker files and data are stored.

The folder structure is:

-   `./preset.yml`: the final generated preset.yml that it's used to configure bootstrap, the nodes, docker, etc.
-   `./addresses.yml`: randomly generated data that wasn't provided in the preset. e.g.: SSL keys, nodes' keys, nemesis accounts, generation hash seed, etc.
-   `./nodes`: it holds the configuration, data and logs for all the defined node instances.
-   `./gateways`: it holds the configuration and logs for all the defined node rest gateways.
-   `./nemesis`: The folder used to hold the nemesis block. Block 1 data is generated via `nemgen` tool for new networks. For existing network, it is copied over.
-   `./databases`: the location where the mongo data is stored for the different database instances.
-   `./docker`: the generated docker-compose.yml, mongo init scripts and server basic bash scripts.
-   `./explorers`: the generated explorer configuration.
-   `./wallets`: the generated wallet configuration.
-   `./reports`: the location of the generated reports.

Note: **The target folder should not be manually modified**. This tool may override any file in the target folder when doing upgrades. Any custom configuration should be provided via a custom preset. Check out the custom preset [guides](docs/presetGuides.md)!

# Requirements

-   Node 12.0.0+
-   Docker 18.3.0+
-   Docker Compose 1.25.0+

Check your user can run docker without sudo:

```
docker run hello-world
```

If you see an error like:

```
Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock
```

Please follow this [guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/how-to-fix-docker-got-permission-denied-while-trying-to-connect-to-the-docker-daemon-socket).

# Installation

It's recommended to run the commands from en empty working dir.

The network configuration, data and docker files will be created inside the target folder ('./target') by default.

```
mkdir my-networks
cd my-networks
```

Once in the working dir:

<!-- usage -->
```sh-session
$ npm install -g symbol-bootstrap
$ symbol-bootstrap COMMAND
running command...
$ symbol-bootstrap (-v|--version|version)
symbol-bootstrap/1.1.0-alpha.0 linux-x64 node-v12.22.1
$ symbol-bootstrap --help [COMMAND]
USAGE
  $ symbol-bootstrap COMMAND
...
```
<!-- usagestop -->

Validate your environment by running:

```
symbol-bootstrap verify
```

The general usage would be:

```
symbol-bootstrap config -p testnet -a dual
symbol-bootstrap compose
symbol-bootstrap run
```

You can aggregate all these commands with this one liner:

```
symbol-bootstrap start -p testnet -a dual
```

If you need to start fresh, you many need to sudo remove the target folder (docker volumes dirs may be created using sudo). Example:

```
sudo rm -rf ./target
```

## Examples

Network presets and assemblies can be combined to generate different types of nodes. Some examples:

-   `$ symbol-bootstrap start -p mainnet -a dual -c customPreset.yml`
-   `$ symbol-bootstrap start -p testnet -a peer -c customPreset.yml`
-   `$ symbol-bootstrap start -p testnet -a demo -c customPreset.yml`
-   `$ symbol-bootstrap start -p dualCurrency -a multinode -c customPreset.yml`
-   `$ symbol-bootstrap start -p dualCurrency -a demo -c customPreset.yml`
-   `$ symbol-bootstrap start -p dualCurrency -a dual -c customPreset.yml`
-   `$ symbol-bootstrap start -p singleCurrency -a multinode -c customPreset.yml`
-   `$ symbol-bootstrap start -p singleCurrency -a demo -c customPreset.yml`

Although some combinations can be done, they may not be really useful. Examples are running `mainnet` and `testnet` combined the `demo` or `multinode` assemblies.

A custom network preset file can also be provided. This is useful when you have your own custom Symbol network, and you want other nodes to join.
For this case, you provide your own `networkPreset.yml` and nemesis feed folder. The node admin can then run:

-   `$ symbol-bootstrap start -p customNetworkPreset.yml -a dual -c customNodePreset.yml`

## Examples

# E2E Testing support

One use case of this CLI is client E2E testing support. If you are coding a Symbol client, you (Travis or Jenkins) can run e2e tests like:

```
symbol-bootstrap start -p dualCurrency -a dual -c my_custom_preset.yml --detached --healthCheck
YOUR TEST (e.g: npm run test, gradle test, selenium etc.)
symbol-bootstrap stop
```

`--detached` starts the server waiting until it is up (by polling the network http://localhost:3000/node/health). The command will fail if the components are not up in 30 seconds.

You can also provide your own custom preset (`-c`) if you want your e2e test to start with a specific state (specific balances addresses, mosaics, namespaces, generation hash seed, etc.)

## Node client E2E via CLI:

The CLI can also be used as npm project (dev) dependency (`npm install --save-dev symbol-bootstrap`). Then you can integrate the network to your npm test cycle.
Your `package.json` can look like this:

```yaml

"devDependencies": {
    ....
    "symbol-bootstrap": "1.1.x",
    ....
}

scripts": {
...
    "clean-network": "symbol-bootstrap clean",
    "run-network": "symbol-bootstrap start -p dualCurrency -a dual -c my_custom_preset.yml --detached --healthCheck",
    "run-stop": "symbol-bootstrap stop",
    "integration-test": "....some mocha/jest/etc tests running against localhost:3000 network....",
    "e2e": "npm run clean-network && npm run run-network && npm run integration-test && npm run stop-network",
...
}
```

Then, you, Jenkins, Travis or your CI tool can run;

```
npm run e2e
```

It's recommended to reuse the same server for multiple tests by using `beforeAll`, `afterAll` kind of statements.
